## 🎯 Project Goal

Can we predict the next circulating variant of COVID-19 based on a selection of features?

We hypothesize that there is typically one predominant circlulating variant of COVID-19 during a timeframe. Using a set of features such as the number of specimens collected, the percentage of specimens collected and the change in variant specimens collected per day we can predict the next predominant circulating variant.

## Early Insights:
This dataset provides insight on the predominant variant over time. 
Some instances of multiple variants circulating, for the most part one variant becomes the predominant variant for a short period of time. 
As that variant starts to decrease, we can see another variant increase and become the predominant variant

## 📝 Summary of Findings NEED TO UPDATE THIS !!!
The logistic regression model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.79, outperforming the
decision tree (0.74). The three strongest predictors of readmission were number of
inpatient visits in the prior year, number of diagnoses recorded at discharge, and
HbA1c result. These findings suggest that care-transition planning — particularly for
high-comorbidity patients with prior hospitalizations — may be the highest-yield
intervention target. Limitations include the dataset's age (1999–2008) and the
exclusion of social determinants of health, which likely confound readmission risk.
